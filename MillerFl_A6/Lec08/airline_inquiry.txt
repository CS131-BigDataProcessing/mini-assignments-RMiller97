# Question 1: What are all the airlines? What awk command did you use to get 
# this information?


"Alaska"
"American"
"Delta"
"Jet Blue"
"Southwest"
"United"

# This was the entire command I used
# awk -F, '{print $4}' airline_stats.csv | sort | uniq
# '{print $4}' is used to print out all the values in the 4th column.
# I then piped that info into sort and uniq, which displayed all the
# unique airlines (i.e. no repeating airlines)

# Question 2A: Which airlines have (include your awk command for part a & b)
# Has a carrier delay greater than 10 and print airline names
# (alphabetically. Hint* pipe input into sort)

"Alaska"
"American"
"Delta"
"Jet Blue"
"Southwest"
"United"

# The command I used was
# awk -F, '$1 > 10 {print $4}' airline_stats.csv | sort | uniq

# Question 2B: Which airlines have: (include your awk command for part a and b)
# Has a carrier delay greater than a certain threshold of 15?
# Use -v to pass in a value that is set to 'Threshold=15'

"Alaska"
"American"
"Delta"
"Jet Blue"
"Southwest"
"United"

# I used this command
# awk -v Threshold=15 -F, '{ if ($1>Threshold) print $4 }' airline_stats.csv|sort|uniq
